# Alpha Releases / Download

Currently the app is in a very raw alpha state and pages are still missing.
However if you want you can download, extract and then run alpha releases [from the releases page](https://github.com/Feichtmeier/settings/releases).

# Building

The following steps are needed to run the app from the source code.

## Install Flutter

Either with

```bash
sudo snap install flutter --classic
```

Or with

```bash
sudo apt install git curl cmake meson make clang libgtk-3-dev pkg-config
mkdir ~/development
cd ~/development
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b master
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
